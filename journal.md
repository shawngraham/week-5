# Week 5 Journal

### Readings
- The introductory musical piece was fascinatingly good. I fell down a rabbit hole reading, and listening to “Assemblage Theory.” 
- Looking at the [digital panopticon](https://www.digitalpanopticon.org/search?targ=multipie&e0.type.t.t=root&e0.has_tattoo.tty.x=yes&tf-multipie-start=sentence&tf-multipie-end=tattoo_subjects), I found navigating its search criteria slightly confusing. I tried to search within the “executed” category for a long time before realizing that it wasn’t, as I assumed, but because there [was actually none,](https://www.digitalpanopticon.org/search?e0.type.t.t=root&e0.given.s.s=&e0.surname.s.s=&e0._all.s.s=&e1.type.t.t=executed&e1.date.d.ld=&e1.date.d.lm=&e1.date.d.ly=&e1.date.d.hd=&e1.date.d.hm=&e1.date.d.hy=) as none of the nearly 2500 executed convicts are recorded as having tattoos. 
- [This](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc4/) article on *The Data-Sitters Club*, from the DH Awards web page, was a good example of the type of literary analysis work topic modelling can assist us with, and as an english minor it intrigued me quite a lot. The author’s suggesting that “the books might be modelling for the reader in a discursive way one of the forms of emotional labor that women are socialized to do in daily life: regulating other people’s emotions for them” emerged from using AntConc to detect instances of “a little” modifying positive or negative terms. 
- I also explored the Queer History Project for a bit, bookmarking [this](https://gizmodo.com/how-90s-cybersex-pioneers-looked-for-action-and-found-c-1831079932) article for later. 


### Audio Mediums
- Audacity— I’ve had this installed on previous machines for small recording projects of my own and I was quite excited to get back into it! 
- Two-Tone— I played around with the provided data and created this short piece: I chose A major because I liked the bouncy feeling the more unusual tonic provided. I played around with some of the different instruments but they mostly just added to the dissonance of it, which I did try to minimize. Instead, I went with 3 lines of melody, 1 bass (for the material) and 2 piano (for the coins). Of the piano lines, I set one to play only the higher notes, using the “filter value” scale, and made its tempo x2, so that it effectively added emphasis to those wealthier (in coin) cities. I kept the bass at a x2 tempo mainly because I just liked the way it sounded— it made the fact that the notes rarely change less of a bug and more of a feature, a gentle *ostinato* supporting the piece. I just wish I could tamper with the notes a little bit to give it more of a feeling of resolution…

### Story Mapping
- Recently [a friend of mine](https://twitter.com/clairequaclaire/status/1267554737466953733) put out on a poll on twitter asking if I was living on unceceded or treaty land. I assumed unceceded because that’s what they always say before public theatre performances and other events here. But when [I googled it](https://native-land.ca/) I found a website mapping aboriginal communities, languages, and treaties, which suggested that my current location was actually part of the “Crawford Purchase” of 1783. [Nicknamed “the gunshot treaty”](http://www.stoneskingston.ca/indigenous-history/the-crawford-purchase/) its boundaries were supposedly “determined by how far the sound of a gunshot carried.” I realized in this investigation that I know next to nothing about aboriginal treaty history, and that this is the type of historical data particularly suited to mapping. 
- To get my gills wet, however, I mucked up a quick map of last summer’s family vacation through western Europe:
